    <p>
      We here at Pursuit of Parks believe that people are never truly connected until they have been in nature together.
      <br />
      In our busy lives we should always make time to appreciate everything nature has to offer.
      <br />
      Please take a second to look up the city you are in and locate the nearest park.
